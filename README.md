# 🦋 Enchanted Wings - Butterfly Species Classification

Welcome to **Enchanted Wings**, a deep learning-based butterfly species classification project built using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to classify butterfly species from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It includes:

- A custom-trained model using `.h5` format  
- Preprocessed image dataset (excluded from Git)  
- A user-friendly Streamlit web interface

## 📦 Files & Git Ignore Policy

Some large or generated files are excluded from version control using `.gitignore`:

### Ignored via `.gitignore`:
- `data/` — The image dataset used for training (large in size)
- `*.h5` — Trained model files, e.g., `butterfly_classifier.h5`

```plaintext
# Inside .gitignore
data/
*.h5
```

To run this project, you’ll need to download or generate the model and dataset locally.
